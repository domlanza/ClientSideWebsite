                        Instructions<br>
                        TO MAKE THE LEMON POPPY SEED MUFFINS:</strong><br>
                    Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F, and line a muffin pan with papers. <br>
                    Place the flour, sugar, poppy seeds, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest in a large mixing bowl, and whisk to combine. <br>
                    Melt the butter in a large liquid measuring cup, and whisk together with the Greek yogurt, milk, eggs, lemon juice, and lemon extract. <br>
                    Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry, and fold together until just barely combined (batter will be very thick). <br>
                    Divide the batter equally between all 12 wells of the muffin pan. <br>
                    Bake the muffins for 5 minutes at 425 degrees F, then turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for 14 to 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the thickest part of a muffin comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. <br>
                    Drizzle with lemon glaze and serve.  <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>   TO MAKE THE LEMON GLAZE: </strong> <br>
                    Place the powdered sugar in a medium bowl, and stir in the lemon juice, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is achieved. <br>

    <h2> Purpose of Website </h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of my website is to provide the 
                 users of it creative recipes every week that I bake myself.
                 As well as past recipes that I found were crowd 
                 favorites. In addition, on the blog portion of the website
                 the users 
                 will be able to post their own recipes and ideas. 
                 My goal is to build a community for all bakers.
                 Simply enough, the way to entice viewers is 
                by making popular food items and have them visit 
                the website to learn how bake them theirselves.
